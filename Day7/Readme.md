# Day 7: Lambda Functions and Higher Order Functions

This file contains the `Day7.py` script, which explores advanced Python function concepts including **lambda expressions**, **higher-order functions**, and their built-in implementations like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

## Contents

- **Calculator Function Practice**
  - Performs various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, average, even/odd filtering.
- **Functions Returning Dictionaries**
  - `build_person()` and `build_profile()` demonstrate dictionary creation with parameters and keyword arguments.
- **Variable-Length Arguments**
  - Using `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexible function inputs.
- **Lambda Functions**
  - Anonymous single-line functions for quick tasks.
  - Comparison between normal and lambda functions.
- **Higher Order Functions (HOFs)**
  - Functions that take or return other functions.
  - Custom examples showing sum of even, odd, and divisible-by-three numbers.
- **Built-in Higher Order Functions**
  - `map()` – Apply a function to all items in an iterable.
  - `filter()` – Select elements meeting a specific condition.
  - `reduce()` – Perform cumulative operations like sum, product, min, max, etc.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to this directory.  
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Day7.py
