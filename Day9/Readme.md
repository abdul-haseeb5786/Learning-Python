# 🐍 Day 9: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## 📘 Overview
This lesson explores **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — a paradigm that organizes code using **classes** and **objects** to model real-world entities.

OOP helps build **scalable**, **reusable**, and **maintainable** applications.

---

## 💡 Advantages of OOP
- Provides a clear structure for programs  
- Makes code easy to maintain, reuse, and debug  
- Follows DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle  
- Enables reusable applications with less code  

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts
1. **Class** – Blueprint for creating objects  
2. **Object** – Instance of a class  
3. **Method** – Functions inside a class  
4. **Encapsulation** – Hiding internal data  
5. **Inheritance** – Reuse features of parent class  
6. **Polymorphism** – Same method, different behavior  
7. **Abstraction** – Show only essential details

## 🧩 Examples

### 1️⃣ Class and Object
```python
class MyClass:
    x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
